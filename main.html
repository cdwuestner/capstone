    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        Crazy Castles is a real-time strategy HTML5 game developed by Bridgette Smith and Chris Wuestner
        (Team Grus) as a final project for CS 467: Online Capstone Project. We primarily used the melonJS
        game engine to develop this game. We also used Tiled to create our gameboard and Texture Packer
        to create animated bases.

    <h3>Rules and How To Play</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>At the main menu, press the [e] key to begin a game at "Easy" difficulty or the [h] key
                to begin a game at "Hard" difficulty. Enemy health capacity (Skeletons and Sorcerers) 
                is doubled on "Hard" difficulty.</li>
            <li>You begin the game with three units already built: one Warrior, one Wizard, and one
                Healer. A flickering effect is applied to whichever unit is currently selected. Press 
                the Spacebar to change which unit is selected.</li>
            <li>Your selected unit will move to whichever location on the gameboard you click</li>
            <li>Melee battles will occur whenever your units come into contact with enemy units. Both
                the player unit and enemy unit will take a random amount of damage based on the attack
                power of the opposing unit.</li>
            <li>If a unit is defeated (its health falls to 0), it is removed from the gameboard.</li>
            <li>Wizard units can use magic to shoot projectiles in four directions that will damage
                enemies that they hit. A selected Wizard can shoot magic with the arrow keys (the up
                key shoots upwards, right key shoots right, etc.). Wizards can inflict a small
                amount of melee damage as well.</li>
            <li>Healer units can use magic to shoot projectiles in four directions that will heal
                player units that they hit. Like wizard magic, a selected Healer's magic is used
                with the arrow keys. Healers cannot inflict any melee damage.</li>
            <li>There are two types of enemy units: Skeletons and Sorcerers. Skeletons have higher maximum 
                health, while Sorcerers are faster and have higher melee attack power.</li>
            <li>Every 20 seconds, you gain another "stored unit". This means that you can add another of
                your units to the gameboard. Press [w] to add a wizard, [e] to add a Healer, and [r] to
                add a Warrior. The number of units you can build (stored units) is displayed above the
                gameboard.</li>
            <li>Every 20 seconds, another enemy unit (either a Skeleton or Sorcerer) is added to the 
                gameboard.</li>
            <li>Each game, there are three randomly-placed bases in the center of the gameboard. A 
                base will turn blue if it is currently occupied by the player, and red if it is occupied
                by the enemy. Each base held provides +25 health capacity to the entire team holding 
                it.</li>
            <li>The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy's Boss, which occupies their castle, before
                the enemy is able to defeat the Princess within your castle.</li>
            <li>Both the Boss and Princess have very high maximum health and melee attack power, but remain
                stationary within their respective castles.</li>
			<li>You may save your game and pause at any time by pressing [p].</li>
        </ul>
